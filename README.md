# Star Trek Info Application

Welcome to the Star Trek Info Application, a Python script that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library for displaying information about Star Trek species and characters.

This application was created by a Star Trek enthusiast, Kain Mason, who wanted to provide an easy-to-use tool for exploring the vast universe of Star Trek. With this application, you can learn about the various species that populate the Star Trek universe and the characters that have become iconic to fans all over the world.

## Getting Started

To use this application, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/. 

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a zip file. 

You will also need to install several libraries, including pandas, matplotlib, and tkinter. You can install these libraries using the following command:

`pip install pandas matplotlib tkinter`

## How to Use

To use the Star Trek Info Application, simply run the Python script `species.py` from the command line or using an integrated development environment (IDE) such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.

The application has three tabs: Home, Species, and Characters. The Home tab displays a welcome message and instructions for using the app, while the Species tab allows the user to select a Star Trek species from a dropdown menu and displays a text description of the selected species. The Characters tab displays a horizontal bar plot of the number of episodes in which each character appears, and allows the user to interactively select a character to see a message box with the number of episodes they appear in.
